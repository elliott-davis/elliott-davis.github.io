I started my first salaried job in 2010 as a sysadmin for the University library.
As a new person in tech, still going to college, I knew nothing. I thought I knew something. After all, I had taken at 
least 2 semesters of Java and worked part-time as a Perl dev :eyeroll:. At that point in my career, the field of unknown
unknowns was vast.

As an intern where I learned Perl, I leaned heavily on the senior members of our team to teach me pretty much everything
about scripting languages. I asked questions non-stop. So many questions in fact, that the Sr engineer had to finally
tell me sometimes it's better to figure it out myself.
