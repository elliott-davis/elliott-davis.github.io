My wife was remarking on how bad my current domain `excellent.io` is to spell when I set her up with an account for email.
She has also recently started taking a C++ fundamentals class and asked how hard it would be to get a new domain that
sounded more developer focused. Seeing as `dumpsterfire.dev` was already taken, I thought the next best word to describe
tech is "tirefire". Now my bank account is short $12 and I am the proud owner of `tirefire.dev`.

Normally I'd buy a domain, set up my email, throw in a DNS redirect to my GitHub page and call it a day. However, I was
inspired by my wife's willingness to step out of her comfort zone and try something new, so I decided to do the same.
I have read others blogs and benefited from their experience, but I've always been afraid to start one myself. Writing
has never been my greatest strength and the paralyzing fear of looking dumb on the internet for missing a comma or poor
grammar has always been a blocker. 

As an engineer, I am always learning, and I don't see why blogging needs to be any different. So, as is with any of the code
I write, PRs welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/elliott-davis/tirefire) if you see any mistakes or want to do a guest
post about your own tirefires.
