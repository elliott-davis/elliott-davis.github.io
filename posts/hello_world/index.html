  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>My wife was remarking on how bad my current domain <code>excellent.io</code> is to spell when I set her up with an account for email.
She has also recently started taking a C++ fundamentals class and asked how hard it would be to get a new domain that
sounded more developer focused. Seeing as <code>dumpsterfire.dev</code> was already taken, I thought the next best word to describe
tech is &ldquo;tirefire&rdquo;. Now my bank account is short $12 and I am the proud owner of <code>tirefire.dev</code>.</p>
<p>Normally I&rsquo;d buy a domain, set up my email, throw in a DNS redirect to my GitHub page and call it a day. However, I was
inspired by my wife&rsquo;s willingness to step out of her comfort zone and try something new, so I decided to do the same.
I have read others blogs and benefited from their experience, but I&rsquo;ve always been afraid to start one myself. Writing
has never been my greatest strength and the paralyzing fear of looking dumb on the internet for missing a comma or poor
grammar has always been a blocker.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I am always learning, and I don&rsquo;t see why blogging needs to be any different. So, as is with any of the code
I write, PRs welcome on <a href="https://github.com/elliott-davis/tirefire">GitHub</a> if you see any mistakes or want to do a guest
post about your own tirefires.</p>
