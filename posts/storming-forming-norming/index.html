I have started developing some tenants of bootstrapping a new team that will hopefully make this storming phase more manageable:</p><h1 id=the-tenants-of-bootstrapping-a-new-engineering-team>The tenants of bootstrapping a new engineering team<a href=#the-tenants-of-bootstrapping-a-new-engineering-team class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><ul><li>We map product value to users, through user stories. Technical details can be added as tasks or as definitions of done<ul><li>This prevents the refactor kings and queens on your team from going down the rabbit hole</li></ul></li><li>We communicate openly in slack and zoom. If you need help, ask for a pair or ask a team for help in slack<ul><li>:shockedpikachu: People are often uncomfortable not looking knowledgeable. Create a culture of leaning and acceptance of failure.</li></ul></li><li>We raise issues early. If something is bugging you or you see a gap, raise the issue as soon as possible<ul><li>Don&rsquo;t let people get to a point of boiling. Set a space for people to raise issues and surface problems early</li></ul></li><li>Rules are enforced as code. Whether it’s through CI linting or editorconfig, we need not nit-pick each other<ul><li>When you see something that bugs you, AUTOMATE FIXING IT. Code review can suck. Make the CI system or your editor the enemy, not your teammates.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m still learning, I&rsquo;m sure there are more tenants that will help teams get through the storming period so feel free to drop in a PR and update this list</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/llm_bot/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
