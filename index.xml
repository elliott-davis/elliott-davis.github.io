I have hit the storming phase several times in my career (the curse of job hopping).</description><content>&lt;p>Invaribally, every new team goes through the storming, forming and norming phases.

&lt;p>I have hit the storming phase several times in my career (the curse of job hopping). I have started developing some tenants of bootstapping a new team that will hopefully make this storming phase more manageable:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-tenants-of-bootstrapping-a-new-engineering-team">The tenants of bootstrapping a new engineering team&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We map product value to users, through user stories. Technical details can be added as tasks or as definitions of done
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This prevents the refactor kings and queens on your team from going down the rabbit hole&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We communicate openly in slack and zoom. If you need help, ask for a pair or ask a team for help in slack
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>:shockedpikachu: People are often uncomfortable not looking knowledgable. Create a culture of leaning and acceptance of failure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We raise issues early. If something is bugging you or you see a gap, raise the issue as soon as possible
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t let people get to a point of boiling. Set a space for people to raise issues and surface problems early&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rules are enforced as code. Whether it’s through CI linting or editorconfig, we need not nit-pick each other
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you see something that bugs you, AUTOMATE FXING IT. Code review can suck. Make the CI system or your editor the enemy, not your teammates.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still learning, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are more tenants that will help teams get through the storming period so feel free to drop in a PR and update this list&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Broadcom VMware Acquisition</title><link>/posts/broadcom-vmware-acquisition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 12:50:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/broadcom-vmware-acquisition/</guid><description>I have a lot of feelings swirling around the announcement that Broadcom is acquiring VMware. When I joined VMware I was under no illusions of its current state. Pretty stagnant, and living on its data center legacy. There were a lot of pivots to public cloud in progress but none of them were really gaining traction in the market. I also knew there was an incredibly talented and empathetic group of people working there.</description><content>&lt;p>I have a lot of feelings swirling around the announcement that Broadcom is acquiring VMware. When I joined VMware I was under no illusions of its current state. Pretty stagnant, and living on its data center legacy. There were a lot of pivots to public cloud in progress but none of them were really gaining traction in the market. I also knew there was an incredibly talented and empathetic group of people working there. I joined because there was a spark of a promise to innovate in spaces that were yet to be discovered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Broadcom announced they were acquiring the VMware, my heart sank. I knew that Broadcom had essentially gutted CA Technologies and Symantec’s research arms so the outlook for my future appeared bleak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That disappointment gave way to fear. I have been at VMware for less than a year AND I’m in research, surely I’m first on the chopping block for a layoff. Broadcom announced that they want to increase VMware’s revenue by close to 4 billion dollars over the next 3 years through “streamlining” and “subscription”. VMware has been trying unsuccessfully to find a functional subscription model for the last 2 years. I can only assume Broadcom will strongarm current customers, accelerating the adoption of public cloud and getting a tighter grip on their current whales. The “streamlining” aspect affects me personally. Obviously there are redundancies in a merger: HR, IT, Physical operations, etc. However, in the office of the CTO, I’m basically in a cost center. Broadcom doesn’t have a great track record for innovation either so I am doubtful that will change now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not to sound cliché but I guess only time will tell what my fate, along with those of my colleagues and teammates will be. Until then, I’ll continue to focus on the levers I can pull and remain in control of.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Asking The Silly Questions</title><link>/posts/silly_questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:59:46 -0600</pubDate><guid>/posts/silly_questions/</guid><description>I started my first salaried job in 2010 as a sysadmin for the University library.

As a new person in tech, still going to college, I knew nothing. I thought I knew something. After all, I had taken at
least 2 semesters of Java and worked part-time as a Perl dev :eyeroll:. At that point in my career, the field of unknown
unknowns was vast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an intern where I learned Perl, I leaned heavily on the senior members of our team to teach me pretty much everything
about scripting languages. I asked questions non-stop. So many questions in fact, that the Sr engineer had to finally
tell me sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s better to figure it out myself.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>/posts/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 11:38:46 -0600</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello_world/</guid><description>My wife was remarking on how bad my current domain excellent.io is to spell when I set her up with an account for email. She has also recently started taking a C++ fundamentals class and asked how hard it would be to get a new domain that sounded more developer focused.

She has also recently started taking a C++ fundamentals class and asked how hard it would be to get a new domain that
sounded more developer focused. Seeing as &lt;code>dumpsterfire.dev&lt;/code> was already taken, I thought the next best word to describe
tech is &amp;ldquo;tirefire&amp;rdquo;. Now my bank account is short $12 and I am the proud owner of &lt;code>tirefire.dev&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally I&amp;rsquo;d buy a domain, set up my email, throw in a DNS redirect to my GitHub page and call it a day. However, I was
inspired by my wife&amp;rsquo;s willingness to step out of her comfort zone and try something new, so I decided to do the same.
I have read others blogs and benefited from their experience, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been afraid to start one myself. Writing
has never been my greatest strength and the paralyzing fear of looking dumb on the internet for missing a comma or poor
grammar has always been a blocker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an engineer, I am always learning, and I don&amp;rsquo;t see why blogging needs to be any different. So, as is with any of the code
I write, PRs welcome on &lt;a href="https://github.com/elliott-davis/tirefire">GitHub&lt;/a> if you see any mistakes or want to do a guest
post about your own tirefires.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
